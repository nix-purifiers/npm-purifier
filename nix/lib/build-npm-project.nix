# buildNpmProject: sandboxed builds of an npm project, from the
# package-lock.json at its root, and from the npm-purifier.lock.json that
# `npm-purifier lock` writes beside it when the project has git
# dependencies. The project needs no Nix files of its own: the lockfiles
# name every tarball and repository the install fetches, and every package
# of the project (the root, its workspaces and the local directories it
# depends on).
#
# Applied to the library of the npm-purifier flake, the file is a package
# for callPackage: the second argument set is what it takes from the
# package set, and the result is the builder. The flake's default overlay
# (`overlays.default`) adds the scope `npm-purifier` to the package set,
# and the scope holds the builder as `buildNpmProject`. A package written
# for callPackage takes the scope by name:
#
#   { npm-purifier }:
#   (npm-purifier.buildNpmProject { src = ./.; }).packages.my-app
#
# `npm-purifier.buildNpmProject.override` replaces what the builder takes,
# and `npm-purifier.overrideScope` replaces what everything in the scope
# shares.
#
# The builder returns
#
#   packages.<name>   package <name> of the project, installed with its
#                     production dependencies under lib/node_modules, with
#                     its commands in bin/; its `tarball` output holds
#                     package.tgz, the file `npm publish` uploads
#   tests             the project's `test` script, run after its build
#                     scripts
#   release           the tarballs `npm-purifier publish` uploads, one per
#                     package of the project, at <name>.tgz with the
#                     package name's `@` left out and its `/` as `__`
#   fetches           the entries of the purifier library that the build
#                     fetches: the locked tarballs and the git dependencies
#   cache             the content of npm's cache: every locked tarball, and
