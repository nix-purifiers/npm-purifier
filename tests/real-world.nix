#   commander   commander.js, a library with TypeScript typings; its test

#   httpServer  http-server, a command with a tap test suite. Its
#               package-lock.json leaves the tarball URL and the integrity

#               outside the project (real-world/http-server), as a flake
#               that packages a project without changing it does, and

#               there.

# The sources are fetched at evaluation time with a pinned hash, so the
# builder reads their lockfiles without import-from-derivation.
